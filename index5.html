                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Modest Mouse is an American rock band formed in 1992 in Issaquah, Washington and currently based in Portland, Oregon. The founding members of this group are lead singer/guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green, and bassist Eric Judy. Strongly influenced by groups such as Pavement, the Pixies, XTC, and Talking Heads, the band rehearsed, rearranged, and recorded demos for almost two years before finally signing with small-town indie label, K Records, and releasing numerous singles. Since the band's 1996 debut album, This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About, the group's lineup has centered on Brock and Green. Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. Guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) joined the band in 2006, shortly following percussionist Joe Plummer (formerly of the Black Heart Procession) and multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, to work on the album We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. Guitarist Jim Fairchild joined the band in 2009.</p>
                <p>The band's sixth album, Strangers to Ourselves, was released on March 17, 2015. The band's name is derived from a passage from the Virginia Woolf story "The Mark on the Wall," which reads, "I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in the minds of modest, mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises."</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>It was during his teenage years that Brock, who at the time was employed at the local family video store just outside Seattle, met bassist Eric Judy. Brock and Judy later ran into drummer Jeremiah Green, who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show and decided to make music together. In 1994, Modest Mouse recorded its first EP, Blue Cadet-3, <b>Do You Connect?</b>, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios. It was released by K Records. A single, "Broke", followed under Sub Pop that was recorded by Steve Wold at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, Sad Sappy Sucker, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before making their way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues.</p>
                
                <p>After moving to Up Records, Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings recorded at Moon Studios, including the 1996 LP <b>This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About</b>. This album was produced and recorded by Steve Wold. The next offering was Interstate 8, also produced by Wold. The 1997 album, The Lonesome Crowded West, turned out to serve as the band's breakthrough. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time, Nick Kraft was brought in to refine the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP <b>The Fruit That Ate Itself</b>. In 1999, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled Building Nothing Out of Something that included the entirety of Interstate 8 except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons".</p>
                
                <p>In 2000, Modest Mouse released <b>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</b>, its first album on Epic Records. The album, produced by Califone's Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago, was critically acclaimed, which included a 9.8 out of 10 score from online music magazine, Pitchfork Media, despite people's concerns about releasing material on a major label. In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP <b>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks</b>, a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of The Moon and Antarctica. In 2002, the band joined Cake, De La Soul, the Flaming Lips, the Hackensaw Boys and Kinky on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour. <b>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</b>, which was released on April 6, 2004 and became certified Platinum the following August,had two hits with "Float On" and "Ocean Breathes Salty". The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album that year, and "Float On" was nominated for Best Rock Song. </p>
                
                <p>Modest Mouse's next album,<b>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</b>, was released on March 20, 2007 after being delayed from December 19, 2006. The bandâ€™s fifth album also included bonus track and single "King Rat", which had caught the eye of a well-known actor before the track was even released. </p>
