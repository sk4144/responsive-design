                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Local Natives (previously known as Cavil at Rest) is an American indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, United States. The current members consist of Taylor Rice (guitar, vocals, bass), Kelcey Ayer (vocals, keyboards, percussion, bass), Ryan Hahn (guitar, keyboards, mandolin, vocals), Matt Frazier (drums), and Nik Ewing (bass). Their debut album, Gorilla Manor, was first released in the UK in November 2009, and later released in the US on February 16, 2010. The album received mostly positive reviews and debuted in the Billboard 200 and at No. 3 in the New Artist Chart. Their sound has been described as "afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies". Clash Music has also described their style as psych folk, or new fangled folk.</p>
                <p>The band came together in Orange County, where Kelcey Ayer, Ryan Hahn, and Taylor Rice attended Tesoro High School. One year after graduating college at UCLA, they were joined by bassist Andy Hamm and drummer Matt Frazier. In December 2008, they all moved to a house in Silver Lake and started work on their debut album.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Everything the band creates comes from a complete collaboration between their members, from songwriting to artwork. Their debut album, Gorilla Manor, was named after the house they all shared in Orange County, where most of the album was written. “It was insanely messy and there were always friends over knocking around on guitars or our thrift store piano,” said Hahn. “It was an incredible experience and I’ll never forget that time.” The self-funded Gorilla Manor was recorded by Raymond Richards in his own Red Rockets Glare Studio, in West Los Angeles, and was produced by Richards and the band.</p>

                <h1>Hummingbird (2013)</h1>
                <p>At Lollapalooza the band announced that they built a new studio and are working on completing their second full length album, Hummingbird, which was released January 29, 2013. Hummingbird was produced by Aaron Dessner of The National, and though it has departed from the "battle-cry urgency" of Gorilla Manor's Sun Hands, singer/guitarist Taylor Rice doesn't look at 'Hummingbird' as a darker album pointing out moments of optimism, and attributing the altered subject matter to the changes and emotions that have come in the last few years since their debut.</p>
                <p>Since 2012, the band has been joined with Nik Ewing as their touring bassist but it was announced at Austin City Limits that he has become an official member on October 11, 2013.</p>

                <h1>Touring</h1>
                <p>The band started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, where initial reviews drew favorable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes, and Vampire Weekend, as well as "sort of a West Coast Grizzly Bear." In 2010 the group's song Wide Eyes became known in Australia after appearing during an election campaign advertisement for the Australian Democrats. In 2011, they embarked on a European tour, served as opening act for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and made their debut in Australia at St Jerome's Laneway Festival.</p>
                <p>In August 2014, at a concert in Salt Lake City, Utah, as part of the Twilight Concert Series, the band announced that they had already begun work on their third studio album.</p>
