                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Titus Andronicus is an American punk/indie rock band from Glen Rock, New Jersey, United States, formed in 2005. The band is composed of singer/lyricist/guitarist Patrick Stickles, drummer Eric Harm, bassist Julian Veronesi, lead guitarist Adam Reich, guitarist Jonah Maurer, and keyboardist Elio DeLuca. The group takes its name from the Shakespeare play Titus Andronicus, and has cited musical and stylistic influences such as Neutral Milk Hotel and Pulp.</p>

                <h1>Career</h1>
                <p>Titus Andronicus's first album, The Airing of Grievances, was released in April 2008 and was described as the sound of a "violent, overblown and irreverent" indie band in a positive review in Pitchfork. The band went on extensive tours of North America and Europe to promote the album through 2009 including a "Bring On The Dudes Tour" with friends The So So Glos and tours opening for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Lucero.</p>
                <p>On March 9, 2010 the band released their sophomore album, The Monitor, through XL Recordings. A sprawling concept album loosely based on themes relating to the American Civil War, it was critically well received, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. That month, Rolling Stone named the band one of the seven best new bands of 2010. The band continued their extensive touring that included a tour of record stores, tours opening for The Pogues, Bright Eyes, and Okkervil River, plus appearances at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Lollapalooza, and Roskilde Festival. Titus Andronicus recorded a version of Nirvana's "Breed" for the tribute album Newermind at this time as well.</p>

                <p>Their third album, Local Business, was released on October 23, 2012. A more stripped down record, Local Business was recorded live in the studio with almost no overdubs, creating an album that was "plug-in-and-play" ready, helping the band sound as close as possible to the album when playing live. It was listed at #38 on Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2012, reached #105 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and gained positive reviews as well as a 7.0 from Pitchfork. Touring for the album included an expansive headlining tour with opener Ceremony, a co-headlining trek of the United Kingdom with Fucked Up, and another tour with The So So Glos dubbed the "Bring Back The Dudes Tour.</p>

                <h1>Recently cont.</h1>
                <p>The band released their fourth album, The Most Lamentable Tragedy, on July 28, 2015 via Merge Records. Taking the form of a 93-minute, 29-song, five-act rock opera (including covers of Daniel Johnston and The Pogues), Stickles described the record as a "complicated metaphor about manic depression, melding elements of philosophy, psychology, and science fiction through the plight of one troubled protagonistâ€™s inner demons." The band also disclosed a film element to the album and thus far released a 15 minute music video covering Act Two.[14] TMLT was released to positive reviews, and the group announced a "TMLT Around The World Tour" covering the United States and Europe.</p>
